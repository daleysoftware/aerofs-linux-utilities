AeroFS Linux Utilities
===

This repository contains a number of scripts that might be useful to AeroFS
users on Linux.

The scripts allow you to do things like:

- Launch the AeroFS daemon directly, without the AeroFS CLI.
- Launch AeroFS in a docker container.

And so on.

Contact: Matt Pillar <mpillar@uwaterloo.ca>

N.B. these scripts are not officially endorsed by AeroFS at this time.
