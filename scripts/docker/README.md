Docker & AeroFS
===

The scripts and configuration files in this repository make it easy to run
AeroFS in a docker container.

This is useful for a variety of reasons, but my favorite use case is running
the AeroFS Team Server in a docker container to improve the availability of
your AeroFS system. If you already have a number of services running in
containers on your infrastructure, why not add AeroFS to the list?

Usage
---

1. Build the AeroFS docker image. The image in this repository is based on
   Ubuntu 14.04.

    ./build-aerofs-image.sh

2. Run/launch the docker container.

    ./run-aerofs-container.sh

3. Configure the container. Here you provide the container with your AeroFS
   credentials and specify whether you would like to run the normal AeroFS
   client software or the AeroFS team server. Configuration is made easy using
   some python scripts that are part another one of my projects,
   [aerofs-upstart](https://github.com/mpillar/aerofs-upstart). Specifically,
   we are making use of the "Quick Install" path for installing AeroFS with
   upstart functionality.

   ./config-aerofs-container.sh <container-id>

After that, your AeroFS container will be up and running.

Notes
---

This is the most basic installation pattern. To enhance this setup, you might
want to use a [data volume](http://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/) or
some similar, more advanced configuration.
